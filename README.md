*Optional enhancement*: -
- *you can further optimise the code and create a os specific executable for the program.*
- *Currently, the program terminates when you press **esc** on you keyboard. You can further customize and enhance the program termination logic*.
- *The program is using python in-build threading library to run the module in a multi-threading enviornment. If anyone have experience and have worked with multi-threading in python. they are invited to enhance the threading behaviour of the program.*
